MAYBE USE GET/PUT??
MAYBE NOT



Quests:
Seperate csv files for text and statistics?

QuestRewards:
0 for no reward
line by line
itemID for reward aka not 0
maybe -1 for no reward and 0 for end of line not sure yet??

QuestStat file layout:
    x, y, type of quest, (x, y)/(monID,monAmt)/(itemID, itemAmt)
    last part is based off of what the type of quest is

QuestText:
Line is for what quest/what part
Know what part to read from (Name$)QStats

NameQStats:
Line by line as usual
-1 is finished, 0 is not started, 1 part complete, etc
HOW TO KNOW HOW MANY PARTS?? - QuestText until 0??
-------
in program

have questtype
x, y as single
type as single
monID/Amt as int
itemID/Amt as int
killColl as int
travelX/Y as single
END TYPE

display quest stats at bottom under map

check after monster killed
-> IF questMonID = combatMonster.numID
->> if it did then increase killColl by 1
->>> if killColl = mon/itemAmt then do next quest part
->>>> if quest finished then give rewards
->>>> if quest not finished update (Name$)QStats
->>>> maybe have a way to give stuff before quest end


->>>> add seperate resource inventory??
->>>> make stackable resources??
->>>> not bother with resources yet just items
->>>> probably make items drop more frequently that have little use or are weak, higher drop rates on them
