RESOURCES:

make seperate type for them
make resourceInventory
display those seperately of inventory
'''''press p for profile, i for inventory page(s) on profile??


can possible make one type, all 0 stats, itemType 8, i think 7 is max right now
itemID is whatever is next

things drop if i do this

need for quests maybe this would work
-> same as itemType
-> gives them all IDs becuase in Items.csv
-> have monsters drop them
-> quest can check the resourceInv array
-> maybe have static locations in resInv?
->> maybe non static just linear search through the inv
->> shouldnt be too slow if not big can work on it if its slow 
-> quest check after type 8 drops
-> forced turn in after x amount of items?? 
->> allow ability to press button for quest list
->> have program ask to turn in and also have a section to turn in quests
->>> normal input command for what to turn in, still numerical
